# SpoofLink
This is a spoof Webpage to extract the location and image of Scammers.
The entire code is in HTML+PHP.
The first page is Payment.html that will be loaded and server page is save_payment.php
Make sure you have folder/Directory name uploads in the same directory where you saved both Payment and save_payment pages.
The uploads folder/Directory should have full permission else you will get an error.
The location and image will be saved in the uploads directory. There will one location_log.txt file that contains the map link. Copy that link and open the browser and enjoy the location of the scammers.
Only one catch is, on the load of the page it will ask to allow the location and allow camera access. But to dodge these pop-ups I have set one alert popup so that the scammer would get confuse. This alert popup won't completely dodge it but might help.
